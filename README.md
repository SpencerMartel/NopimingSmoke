🚨 Wildfire Smoke Animation – Nopiming Provincial Park wildfire 🌲🔥

So far in June 2025, my hometown of Montreal has had some of the worst air quality in the world due to smoke from wildfires in Quebec and Manitoba. Motivated by this (and having an excuse to stay inside), I made this animation to visualize near-surface smoke from the ongoing wildfire in Nopiming Provincial Park, Manitoba.

🔍 What’s being visualized?
This video shows the mass density of smoke particles at 8 meters above ground. It represents how concentrated wildfire smoke is near the surface, which directly affects local air quality and public health. Values are given in µg/m³.

🛰️ NOAA's HRRR-Smoke data
The data for the visualization comes from NOAA’s HRRR-Smoke model, accessed via AWS. The HRRR-Smoke system uses satellite-detected fire activity, meteorological modeling, and aerosol dispersion physics to forecast smoke spread in high resolution. It’s a powerful tool for visualizing how wildfire impacts extend far beyond the burn area.
